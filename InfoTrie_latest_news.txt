That must mean <i>tech</i> workers don\u2019t think a <i>technology</i> startup is a good bet and instead apply at a big company like UnitedHealth Group.\\\nPearson stepped aside as co-CEO of Jamf a couple of years ago, but he has no plans to chip away at the problem by starting another,that our region\u2019s startup <i>technology</i> sector is a lot bigger \u2014 and has created a lot more wealth \u2014 than most people probably realize.\\\nAs a guy who still lives a short walk from where he went to high school in St. Paul, this misperception matters to him, too. It pains him to see talented young, people decide better opportunities must lie out of state. And while he doesn\u2019t quite come out and say it, he seems bugged they may take jobs at companies like U.S. Bancorp or Target, too.\\\nHe knows success in <i>technology</i> startups will breed more success, as a <i>technology</i> industry cluster gathers momentum, several billion dollars of total sale proceeds.\\\nWallace later refreshed his research and compared notes with Jeff Sellner, leader of accounting firm CliftonLarsonAllen\u2019s <i>technology</i> practice. Their combined list had more than $7 billion in sale proceeds in the past 10 years, from the closed sale of a, little over two dozen software and other <i>technology</i> companies.\\\nAs Sellner pointed out: \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of companies flying under the radar. Even when some of these have sizable events, sales in the couple hundred million dollar range, they don\u2019t hit the headlines. I suspect this list should be, big deal,\u201d Pearson said.\\\nPart of Pearson\u2019s challenge in getting more attention for <i>technology</i> startups, including from job candidates, stems from the success our region has had developing and keeping its constellation of corporate headquarters. As Pearson put it, \u201cthe Twin Cities is a company town,, of many different companies.\u201d\\\nHe sees the impact of those companies in data about <i>technology</i> talent, from lists such as one produced by the real estate firm CBRE. The Twin Cities region seems to have more than its share of good jobs in <i>technology</i> fields, but it\u2019s underrepresented in the number of, enterprise software company himself.
